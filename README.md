# reven
Destroys your pc. Not much but with exe its really bad.

## Risks
- Losing datas that not saved in apps,
- RAM/CPU Upping,
- Reduces the PC's performance.

## Stay legal
Dont use the exe/python file that i shared on this projects on real PCs or anybody's pc, just use it on a virtual box.

## Usage
- Download/clone the py/exe file.
- After downlading, run this:
- For exe:

- For python:
reven.py

## I dont take any responsibility
**[IMPORTANT!]** I don't take any responsibility for everything of the program/file does.
